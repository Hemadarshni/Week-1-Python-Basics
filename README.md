Week 1: Python Basics – Personal Introduction Program
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of Week 1 – Python Basics. The objective is to understand the fundamentals of Python programming by creating a simple Personal Introduction Program. The program takes user input, stores it using variables, and displays a friendly welcome message. This project helps build confidence in writing and running Python programs.

🎯 Project Objectives

Understand what programming is and how Python code runs

Learn how to use variables to store data

Take user input using input()

Display output using print() and f-strings

Work with basic data types like strings and lists

Build a complete beginner-level Python program

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3.x

Editor: VS Code / IDLE / Any text editor

Version Control: Git & GitHub

⚙️ Setup Instructions

Step 1: Install Python & Jupyter Notebook
- Install **Python 3.x** from the official Python website
- Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

Step 2: Open the Project

Navigate to the project folder in Jupyter

Open personal_intro.ipynb

Run cells one by one using Shift + Enter

Python -- version 3.13.3

Step 3: Run the Program

Open the project folder

Open terminal/command prompt

Run:

python personal_intro.ipynb

🧠 How the Program Works
Step-by-Step Logic

The program asks the user for their name

It asks for age, hobby, and favorite food

User inputs are stored in variables

A list is used to store hobbies and food

A friendly welcome message is displayed using f-strings

🧩 Concepts Used

Variables: Store user information

Strings: Handle text input and output

Lists: Store multiple related values

Input/Output: input() and print() functions

Program Flow: Code runs line by line

🧪 Testing & Validation

The program was tested with different inputs to ensure correct output.

Input Type	Example	Result

Name	Hemadarshni Harikrishnan	Displayed correctly

Age	27	Displayed correctly

Hobby	Badminton	Displayed correctly

No errors were found during testing.

🧾 Code Organization

All code is written in a single Jupyter Notebook: personal_intro.ipynb

Code is split into logical cells

Markdown cells are used for headings and explanations

Comments are added for clarity and readability
